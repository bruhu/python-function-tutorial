This is a basic Python tutorial for beginners on how to create functions. Here we will explore the basic high-level concepts of how to create them and some practical considerations when typing them. We will cover briefly (from the practical point of view) the following topics:

* Function syntax
* Variable scoping
* Function arguments
* Optional arguments
* Returning multiple variables
* Important considerations
* Converting Python code into a function

Open the content of the `tutorial.ipynb` notebook, read it carefully and try the small exercises at the end.

WARNING: This is a na√Øve tutorial intended to be practical. The main focus has been to introduce you to the practicalities of how to define and use functions in Python, alongside some good coding practices. It's not pretending to be technical. I wish you the best in learning. Feedback is welcome.
