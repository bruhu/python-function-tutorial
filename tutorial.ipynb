    "A Python function is a short block of code that can be executed as many times as desired. As an example, `print()` and `type()` are two examples of Python functions. When we write our functions, there are several good practices to follow. \n",
    "\n",
    "First:\n",
    "\n",
    "All the functions must do **only one specific task** and do it well. This doesn't mean that the Python block of code only consists of one single line of code; it can contain loops, several variable assignments, etc. That means **only one specific task** is one conceptual TASK (change the format of a variable, filter a list, train a model, ...etc). If we find that our function is doing more than one task, is better to split the function into two functions. For example, imagine that we defined a function named `train_and_evaluate_model()`. This will not be a good idea. Is better to define two functions: `train_model()` and `evaluate_model()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second:\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the previous examples all the user-defined functions (there are other types of functions) **must have a self-explanatory name** that allows us to identify what is the function goal. Of course, we can use any desired name for our functions. However, over time it will be harder to know the purpose of our function. In addition: don't use uppercase letters or numbers, and don't include white spaces on the function name (replace them with underscores). \n",
    "\n",
    "Third:\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a good practice to add a `docstring` to the function. A `docstring` is a multiline Python string that explains: what is the function going to do, what are the types of arguments, and what the outputs types. "

    "To create a function in Python we need to use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name():\n",
    "   \"\"\"\n",
    "   docstring\n",
    "   \"\"\"\n",

Next, are two examples bad and good function names: `d()` and `days_until_end_of_year()`. Don't you agree that the second function name is more meaningful than the first one?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see in the previous example, the function definition starts with the **keyword** `def` followed by the function's name (please don't name your function as `def()`), parentheses, and `:`. Next, it contains the `docstring` which is optional but a good practice to include because this will allow you and third parties to understand what is the function's purpose, the arguments, the outputs, and their types (integers, floats, lists, tuples,..etc). One example of a `docstring` could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def days_until_end_of_year():\n",
    "   \"\"\"\n",
    "   This function computes how many days are left until the end of the year based on the current date.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Inputs: \n",
    "   None\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Outputs:\n",
    "   Integer with the number of days left until the end of the year\n",
    "   \"\"\"\n",
    "   ...\n",
    "   [return]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "in this way, anyone who wants to know how to use our function will know it by reading the documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is important to notice that the code inside the function must be **indented**. What does this mean? It means that we must start the function's lines of code leaving four white spaces before (or a tab). That's how Python identifies that those lines of code belong to the function and not to the main program. If we don't include indentation, Python will consider the lines of code as part of the main program. It's very important to pay attention to this point when we copy and paste Python code from one text editor to another because this indentation can be lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you might wonder what are the `...` dots after the `docstring`. They represent any amount of lines of code. They could be `print()` statements, variable declarations,...etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have the `return` clause within square brackets. The square brackets mean that the `return` clause is optional. In other words, including the `return` clause (without the square brackets) is optional. What is the purpose of the `return` clause? When we define a Python function, we usually want to do a calculation, a plot, a new variable,...etc, and store this variable **into another one external to the function**. If we don't include a `return` clause we can still make calculations, plots,...etc but we will not be able to store them into another variable external to the function.\n",
    "However, **by default the returned value of a function is `None` unless we use the `return` clause** to overwrite the returned value. What does mean this? Let's loos a couple of examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "   print(\"The number of days until the end of the year is: \", days_to_end_of_year)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "this function doesn't include a `return` and it will print the desired value on the screen. However, we will not be able to store this value in another variable external to the function. See the code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "days_left = days_until_end_of_year()\n",
    "print(days_left)\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def days_until_end_of_year():\n",
    "   \"\"\"\n",
    "   This function computes how many days are left until the end of the year based on the current date.\n",
